### Working Paper

* **The Impact of Welfare Reforms on the Mental Health of Working-Age Individuals in the UK**
(with Prof. Corrado Giulietti and Prof. Michael Vlassopoulos)

Austerity measures introduced after the global financial crisis of 2008 had important consequences for the economies and societies that adopted them. In the United Kingdom (UK), the Welfare Reform Act in 2012 introduced important reforms on social benefits with some of them impacting large proportions of the population (e.g., the Council Tax Benefit) and others leading to important financial losses (e.g., the Disability Living Allowance). This paper estimates the causal effect of these welfare reforms on the mental health of working age individuals affected by the reforms applying a difference-in-differences approach and a panel event study analysis.


### Work in progress

* **The impact of Body Mass Index on labour market outcomes in UK**

I provide up to date evidence on the extent that individuals from the most attached age group (25-54 years old) in the labour market are disadvantaged based on their Body Mass Index (BMI) due to potential lower productivity or discrimination. More specifically, I estimate the causal impact of BMI on employment and hourly wages of prime working age individuals for the case of the UK.

* **Body Mass Index and Social Interactive Occupations**

 I estimate the impact of BMI on the probability of individuals to be in social interactive occupations. Also, I explore the importance of being in a social interactive occupation on the wage gap among obese and non-obese individuals.
