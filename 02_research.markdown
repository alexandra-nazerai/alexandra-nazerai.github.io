### Working Paper
#### The Impact of Welfare Reforms on the Mental Health of Working-Age Individuals in the UK
(with Prof. Corrado Giulietti and Prof. Michael Vlassopoulos)

Austerity measures introduced after the global financial crisis of 2008 had important consequences for the economies and societies that adopted them. In the United Kingdom (UK), the Welfare Reform Act in 2012 introduced important reforms on social benefits with some of them impacting large proportions of the population (e.g., the Council Tax Benefit) and others leading to important financial losses (e.g., the Disability Living Allowance). This paper estimates the causal effect of these welfare reforms on the mental health of working age individuals affected by the reforms applying a difference-in-differences approach and a panel event study analysis.
