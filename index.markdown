### Hello,

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/about/faculties-schools-departments/economic-social-and-political-sciences). My research interests include areas of applied microeconomics. More specifically, I focus in health and labour economics.
